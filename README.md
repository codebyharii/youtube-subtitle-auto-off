# YouTube Subtitle Auto Off

A lightweight browser extension that automatically turns off subtitles on YouTube videos for users who prefer captions disabled.

---

## ❗ Problem Description

In the Brave browser, YouTube subtitles (captions) may automatically turn **ON** even after the user manually disables them.

This behavior usually occurs due to:
- Inconsistent storage of subtitle preferences by YouTube
- Privacy and shield features in Brave that reset or block preference data
- Automatic subtitle activation based on video language or regional settings

As a result, users may experience subtitles being re-enabled:
- After refreshing the page
- When a new video starts
- During autoplay
- Even immediately after turning captions OFF

## ✅ Solution

This extension automatically detects when subtitles are enabled on a YouTube video and turns them off.

It runs only on **youtube.com** and works silently in the background, ensuring a consistent viewing experience for users who prefer subtitles disabled.
